# Crapjack-dice-game
My first full Python script. Crapjack is a two player dice game similar to the card game Blackjack. It's crappy but it works!

In March 2020 I started Paul J. Deitel's five-part online course called "Python Fundamentals". After completing part
one, I decided to try and put everything I've learned into one script. Crapjack is that script!

Thanks for checking it out.
